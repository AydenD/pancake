In a large bowl, whisk the flour, baking powder and sugar together. In a separate bowl whisk the eggs, milk, butter and vanilla together. Make a well in the centre of the dry ingredients and whisk in the milk mixture to make a smooth batter.
Heat a large, lightly greased non-stick frying pan over a low-medium heat. Working in batches of three at a time, pour Â¼ cups of batter into the pan. Cook the pancakes for 1-2 minutes, until bubbles break on the surface and the underside is golden brown. Flip the pancakes over and cook for 1 minute and remove from the pan onto a plate. Keep a clean tea towel over the plate of cooked pancakes to keep them warm.
Stack and serve the pancakes with maple syrup and blueberries or the topping of your choice. If you're looking for something more gourmet, choose from some of our sweet and savoury topping ideas below.
